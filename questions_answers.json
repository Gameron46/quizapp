Then diagram the first statement. Tallest: F L M After reading the second statement, you can put Jodi into the diagram, but not Noah. All we know about Noah is that he goes somewhere to the left of Mickey; we don't know how his height compares with that of Fernando or Lisa. Tallest: F L M J After reading the third statement, we are still not sure about Noah's position. We know he is shorter than Fernando, but he could fit on either side of Lisa.

        {"question": "People who graduate from North College are expected to donate at least $500 per year to the school. Sydney donates $100 per year to North College. Based only on the information above, which of the following must be true?",
        "options": ["F. Sydney did not graduate from North College.", "G. If Sydney earned more money, she would donate more to the college.","H.  If all graduates donated only $100 per year, North College could not continue to operate.","J. If Sydney graduated from North College, she does not do what is expected of her.","K. Sydney contributes other services to North College to compensate for her lower financial contribution"],
        "answer": "J. If Sydney graduated from North College, she does not do what is expected of her.",
        "explanation": "We must check each option against the facts presented to determine which option is valid. We know nothing about Sydney except the size of her donation to North College. Thus, Option F, although it might be true, cannot be validly concluded. Options G and H also might be true, but we don't know that from the information given. The same is true for Option K. Option J is a valid conclusion, since we are told that graduates are expected to donate more than Sydney donates, and Sydney might or might not be a graduate."},
        
        {"question": "A species is extinct when it no longer has any living members. Scientists thought that fish species X was extinct. In 1980, a fisherman caught a living member of species X. This species is now known to live in large numbers in the near-freezing water of the north Atlantic Ocean. Based only on the information above, which of the following statements is a valid conclusion?",
        "options": ["A. Species X was never actually extinct.", "B. Species X was extinct, but reappeared in 1980.", "C. Species X has been discovered, but will soon become extinct.","D. There are other living species that are thought to be extinct","E. Living members of extinct species are found only in the ocean."],
        "answer": "A. Species X was never actually extinct.",
        "explanation": "According to the definition given, a species is extinct when no more members are living. Therefore, Option B is impossible. Option C is incorrect because there is no statement to suggest that the species will soon be extinct. Option D may be true, but it cannot be deduced from the given statements. The question says nothing about other living species that are thought to be extinct. Option E is false; nothing can be living and extinct at the same time. Option A is correct; if a living fish were caught, it was never extinct."},

If Peter's mother does not come home in time, Sarah will not go to the party.","J. Sarah will not go to the party unless John goes.","K.  If John goes to the party, then Peter will go."],
        "answer": "F. If Peter's mother comes home in time, then John will not go to the party.",
        "explanation": "This question contains two conditional statements. It is important that you read each statement carefully. The first sentence may be restated as, 'If Sarah goes to the party, then John will not go.' This is simply a rearrangement of the two clauses of the first condi- tion and there is no change in meaning. Note that the sentence only tells us what will happen if Sarah goes to the party. It says nothing about what will happen if Sarah does not go to the party. Therefore, it is incor- rect to conclude that John will go to the party if Sarah does not go. It is also incorrect to conclude that John will not go to the party if Sarah does not go. We simply do not know what will happen. Likewise, the second sentence can be restated as, 'If Peter's mother comes home in time, then Sarah will go.' However, it does not tell us what will happen if Peter's mother does not come home in time. Option F is correct; if Peter's mother comes home in time, Sarah will go to the party and, if she goes, John will not go. Option G is wrong because the first condi- tion does not say what will happen if John does not go to the party. Sarah may or may not go to the party, while John does not. The previous paragraph explains why Option H is wrong. Option J contradicts the first statement, and Option K can be ruled out because no information is given about Peter going to the party."},

They are numbered consecutively from bottom to top. 1) One shape is a triangle. 2) The circle is the fourth shape. 3) There are exactly three shapes between the rectangle and the square. 4) There are exactly two shapes lower than the oval; one of them is the rectangle. In which position is the triangle?",

Then look for specific locations of each shape. Statement two says that the circle is the fourth shape; write 'circle' next to 4. Statement four tells you that exactly two shapes are lower than the oval, which means the oval is position 3. Since there are exactly three shapes between the rectangle and the square, these two must be in the first and fifth positions; and, since statement four says the rectangle is lower than the oval, you can write 'rectangle' next to 1 and 'square' next to 5. That leaves the triangle in position 2:\nTop\n5 = square\n4 = circle\n3 = oval\n2 = triangle\n1 = rectangle\n Bottom"},

All of the officers at the air show wore their uniforms.","K. If Peter was a pilot at the air show, then he wore his uniform"],
        "answer": "H. If Zelda was an officer at the air show, then she must be a pilot.",
        "explanation":"To answer this question correctly, it is important to understand the relationships among the groups of people who attended the air show-officers, pilots, and pilots who wore their uniforms. It is also neces- sary to realize that some people who attended the air show might not belong to any of these groups. The question says that all officers were pilots, and that some pilots (not all) wore their uniforms. This is the extent of the information given about the officers and pilots who attended. Read each option and evaluate whether it must be true, based on the information given. Option F may or may not be true; the persons wearing uniforms may or may not be pilots. There is not enough informa- tion given to decide. Option G is incorrect because it is possible that people other than pilots attended the air show. The information given does not rule out that possibility. Option H says that an officer who attended the air show (Zelda) must be a pilot. According to the information given, this conclusion must be true. Options J and K can be ruled out because the officers and pilots may or may not have worn their uniforms. It might be helpful to draw a diagram to illustrate the relationships among the groups of people at the air show. The overlapping circles in the diagram show that some pilots (and officers) wore uniforms, but not necessarily all of them. It also shows that some people wearing uniforms may not be pilots or officers. The diagram can be used to rule out Options F, G, J, and K, and to support Option H as the correct answer.",

Jack played the violin for two years, beginning with the first year. Put an X under Year 1 for violin. We do not know when he played his second year of vio- lin. One possibility is that he played it in the second year. Put an X under Year 2 for violin as well. Since he played only the violin in the first year, he could not have started the viola in Year 1. He could have played it in Years 2, 3, and 4 (see Figure 2 below).

Because the question asks for the driver at the far right, start with the infor- mation about the drivers. According to Statements 2 and 3, Marquise stands to the right of both Anya and Jorge. There is no information about Patrick's posi- tion. Based only on this information, there are several possible orders (using the first initial of each driver). PAJM AJMP AJPM Maybe the colors of the cars will help to place Patrick. Patrick did not drive the white car (Statement 3), the silver car (Statement 4), or the orange car (Statement 5). Therefore, Patrick must drive the brown car. The brown car was to the right of the orange car (Statement 1), but that leaves two possible orders of cars, with an initial standing for each color.

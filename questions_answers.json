Then diagram the first statement. Tallest: F L M After reading the second statement, you can put Jodi into the diagram, but not Noah. All we know about Noah is that he goes somewhere to the left of Mickey; we don't know how his height compares with that of Fernando or Lisa. Tallest: F L M J After reading the third statement, we are still not sure about Noah's position. We know he is shorter than Fernando, but he could fit on either side of Lisa. However, we can now answer the question. Noah is either second or third, but his exact position cannot be determined from the information given."},
        
        {"question": "People who graduate from North College are expected to donate at least $500 per year to the school. Sydney donates $100 per year to North College. Based only on the information above, which of the following must be true?",
        "options": ["F. Sydney did not graduate from North College.", "G. If Sydney earned more money, she would donate more to the college.","H. If all graduates donated only $100 per year, North College could not continue to operate.","J. If Sydney graduated from North College, she does not do what is expected of her.","K. Sydney contributes other services to North College to compensate for her lower financial contribution"],
        "answer": "J. If Sydney graduated from North College, she does not do what is expected of her.",
        "explanation": "We must check each option against the facts presented to determine which option is valid. We know nothing about Sydney except the size of her donation to North College. Thus, Option F, although it might be true, cannot be validly concluded. Options G and H also might be true, but we don't know that from the information given. The same is true for Option K. Option J is a valid conclusion, since we are told that graduates are expected to donate more than Sydney donates, and Sydney might or might not be a graduate."},
        
        {"question": "A species is extinct when it no longer has any living members. Scientists thought that fish species X was extinct. In 1980, a fisherman caught a living member of species X. This species is now known to live in large numbers in the near-freezing water of the north Atlantic Ocean. Based only on the information above, which of the following statements is a valid conclusion?",
        "options": ["A. Species X was never actually extinct.", "B. Species X was extinct, but reappeared in 1980.", "C. Species X has been discovered, but will soon become extinct.","D. There are other living species that are thought to be extinct","E. Living members of extinct species are found only in the ocean."],
        "answer": "A. Species X was never actually extinct.",
        "explanation": "According to the definition given, a species is extinct when no more members are living. Therefore, Option B is impossible. Option C is incorrect because there is no statement to suggest that the species will soon be extinct. Option D may be true, but it cannot be deduced from the given statements. The question says nothing about other living species that are thought to be extinct. Option E is false; nothing can be living and extinct at the same time. Option A is correct; if a living fish were caught, it was never extinct."},

If Peter's mother does not come home in time, Sarah will not go to the party.","J. Sarah will not go to the party unless John goes.","K. If John goes to the party, then Peter will go."],
        "answer": "F. If Peter's mother comes home in time, then John will not go to the party.",
        "explanation": "This question contains two conditional statements. It is important that you read each statement carefully. The first sentence may be restated as, 'If Sarah goes to the party, then John will not go.' This is simply a rearrangement of the two clauses of the first condi- tion and there is no change in meaning. Note that the sentence only tells us what will happen if Sarah goes to the party. It says nothing about what will happen if Sarah does not go to the party. Therefore, it is incor- rect to conclude that John will go to the party if Sarah does not go. It is also incorrect to conclude that John will not go to the party if Sarah does not go. We simply do not know what will happen. Likewise, the second sentence can be restated as, 'If Peter's mother comes home in time, then Sarah will go.' However, it does not tell us what will happen if Peter's mother does not come home in time. Option F is correct; if Peter's mother comes home in time, Sarah will go to the party and, if she goes, John will not go. Option G is wrong because the first condi- tion does not say what will happen if John does not go to the party. Sarah may or may not go to the party, while John does not. The previous paragraph explains why Option H is wrong. Option J contradicts the first statement, and Option K can be ruled out because no information is given about Peter going to the party."},

They are numbered consecutively from bottom to top. 1) One shape is a triangle. 2) The circle is the fourth shape. 3) There are exactly three shapes between the rectangle and the square. 4) There are exactly two shapes lower than the oval; one of them is the rectangle. In which position is the triangle?",

Then look for specific locations of each shape. Statement two says that the circle is the fourth shape; write 'circle' next to 4. Statement four tells you that exactly two shapes are lower than the oval, which means the oval is position 3. Since there are exactly three shapes between the rectangle and the square, these two must be in the first and fifth positions; and, since statement four says the rectangle is lower than the oval, you can write 'rectangle' next to 1 and 'square' next to 5. That leaves the triangle in position 2:\nTop\n5 = square\n4 = circle\n3 = oval\n2 = triangle\n1 = rectangle\n Bottom"},

All of the officers at the air show wore their uniforms.","K. If Peter was a pilot at the air show, then he wore his uniform"],
        "answer": "H. If Zelda was an officer at the air show, then she must be a pilot.",
        "explanation":"To answer this question correctly, it is important to understand the relationships among the groups of people who attended the air show-officers, pilots, and pilots who wore their uniforms. It is also neces- sary to realize that some people who attended the air show might not belong to any of these groups. The question says that all officers were pilots, and that some pilots (not all) wore their uniforms. This is the extent of the information given about the officers and pilots who attended. Read each option and evaluate whether it must be true, based on the information given. Option F may or may not be true; the persons wearing uniforms may or may not be pilots. There is not enough informa- tion given to decide. Option G is incorrect because it is possible that people other than pilots attended the air show. The information given does not rule out that possibility. Option H says that an officer who attended the air show (Zelda) must be a pilot. According to the information given, this conclusion must be true. Options J and K can be ruled out because the officers and pilots may or may not have worn their uniforms. It might be helpful to draw a diagram to illustrate the relationships among the groups of people at the air show. The overlapping circles in the diagram show that some pilots (and officers) wore uniforms, but not necessarily all of them. It also shows that some people wearing uniforms may not be pilots or officers. The diagram can be used to rule out Options F, G, J, and K, and to support Option H as the correct answer.",

Jack played the violin for two years, beginning with the first year. Put an X under Year 1 for violin. We do not know when he played his second year of vio- lin. One possibility is that he played it in the second year. Put an X under Year 2 for violin as well. Since he played only the violin in the first year, he could not have started the viola in Year 1. He could have played it in Years 2, 3, and 4 (see Figure 2 below).

Because the question asks for the driver at the far right, start with the infor- mation about the drivers. According to Statements 2 and 3, Marquise stands to the right of both Anya and Jorge. There is no information about Patrick's posi- tion. Based only on this information, there are several possible orders (using the first initial of each driver). PAJM AJMP AJPM Maybe the colors of the cars will help to place Patrick. Patrick did not drive the white car (Statement 3), the silver car (Statement 4), or the orange car (Statement 5). Therefore, Patrick must drive the brown car. The brown car was to the right of the orange car (Statement 1), but that leaves two possible orders of cars, with an initial standing for each color.

        "explanation": "Let x = the total minutes of the call. Therefore, x - 1 = the additional minutes of the call. This choice is correct because in order to calculate the cost, the charge is 35 cents plus 15 cents times the number of additional minutes. If y represents the total cost, then y equals 0.35 plus 0.15 times the quantity - 1. This translates to y = 0.35 +0.15(x- 1) or y = 0.15(x-1)+0.35."

The expression for the cost of a ride with Luxury Limo is 1x + 3.25. To solve, set the two expressions equal to each other: 1.25x + 2 = 1x+3.25. Subtract 2 from both sides: 1.25x + 2-2 = 1x+3.25 -2. This simplifies to: 1.25x = 1x + 1.25; subtract 1x from both sides: 1.25x-1x=1x- 1x + 1.25. Divide both sides of the equation by .25: .25x/.25 =  1.25/.25.

        "options": ["A. 42", "B. 18", "C. 63", "D. 60"],
        "answer": "D. 60",
        "explanation": "Let x = the amount of coffee at $3 per pound. Let y = the total amount of coffee purchased. If there are 18 pounds of coffee at $2.50 per pound, then the total amount of coffee can be expressed as y = x + 18. Use the equation 3x + 2.50(18) = 2.85y since the average cost of the y pounds of coffe is $2.85 per pound. To solve, substitute y = x + 18 into 3x + 2.50(18) 2.85y. 3x+2.50(18) = 2.85(x+18). Multiply on the left side and use the distributive property on the right side: 3x + 45 = 2.85x + 51.30. Subtract 2.85x on both sides: 3x-2.85x+45 = 2.85x-2.85x+ 51.30. Simplify: 0.15x +45 = 51.30. Subtract 45 from both sides: 0.15x+45-45 = 51.30-45. Simplify: 0.15x = 6.30. Divide both sides by 0.15: 0.15x/0.15 = 6.30/0.15; so, x = 42 pounds, which is the amount of coffee that costs $3 per pound. Therefore, the total amount of coffee is 42 + 18, which is 60 pounds."

        "explanation": "Let x = the amount of candy at $1.90 per pound. Let y = the total number of pounds of candy purchased. If it is known that there are 40 pounds of candy at $2.15 per pound, then the total amount of candy can be expressed as y=x+40. Use the equation 1.90x + 2.15(40) = $158.20 since the total amount of money spent was $158.20. Multiply on the left side: 1.90x + 86 = 158.20. Subtract 86 from both sides: 1.90x+86-86 = 158.20 -86. 1.90 72.20. Simplify: 1.90x 72.20.

Since there are 50 more packets of the $1.26 seeds than the $1 seeds, y = x + 50. Use the equation 1x + 1.26y= 420 to find the total number of packets of each. By substituting into the second equation, you get 1x + 1.26(x + 50) = 402. Multiply on the left side using the distributive property: 1x + 1.26x+63 402. Combine like terms on the left side: 2.26x+63 = 402. Subtract 63 from both sides: 2.26x+63-63 = 402 63. Simplify: 2.26.x = 339.

First check to see if there is a common factor in each of the terms or if it is the difference between two perfect squares, and it is neither of these.

        "answer": "B. (3x-1)(x-2)",
        "explanation": "Since the trinomial does not have a coefficient of one on its highest exponent term, the easiest way to find the answer to this problem is to use the distributive property. First, using the original trinomial, identify the sum and product by looking at the terms when the trinomial is in descending order (highest exponent first): 3x^2 - 7x+2.The sum is the middle term, in this case, -7x. The product is the product of the first and last terms, in this case, (3x^2)(2) = 6x^2. Now, identify two quantities whose sum is -7x and product is 6x^2, namely -6x and -x. Rewrite the original trinomial using these two terms to replace the middle term in any order: 3x^2-6x-x+2. Now factor by grouping by taking a common factor out of each pair of terms. The common factor of 3x^2 and -6x is 3x and the common factor of -x and 2 is -1.Therefore, 3x^2-6x-x+2 becomes 3x(x-2)-1(x-2). (Notice that if this expression were multiplied back out and simplified, it would correctly yield the original polynomial.) Now, this two-term expression has a common factor of (x-2) which can be factored out of each term using the distributive property: 3x(x − 2) - 1(x − 2) becomes (x − 2)(3x-1). The dimensions of the courtyard are (x-2) and (3x-1)."

Area of a rectangle is length times width so multiply the expressions together and set them equal to the total area of 288 square inches: (2x+12)(2x+14) = 288. Multiply the binomials using the distributive property: 4x^2 + 28x + 24x + 168 = 288. Combine like terms: 4x^2 + 52x + 168 = 288. Subtract 288 from both sides: 4x^2 + 52x+168-288 = 288-288; simplify: 4x^2+ 52x-120 = 0. Factor the trinomial completely: 4(x^2 + 13x-30) = 0; 4(x-2)(x+15) = 0. Set each factor equal to zero and solve: 4 does not equal 0 or x-2=0 or x+15=0; x = 2 or x = -15. Reject the negative solution because you will not have a negative width. The width is 2 feet. Therefore, the larger dimension of the frame is 2(2) + 14 = 4+14= 18 inches."

Multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator, 40x, results in the equation 4x + 40 = 10x. Subtract 4x from both sides of the equation. 4x-4x+40=10x-4x.

        "answer": "D. 544 ft^2",
        "explanation": "The area of the walkway is equal to the entire area (area of the walkway and pool) minus the area of the pool. The area of the entire region is length times width. Since the pool is 20 feet wide and the walkway adds 4 feet onto each side, the width of the rectangle formed by the walkway and pool is 20 + 4 + 4 = 28 feet. Since the pool is 40 feet long and the walkway adds 4 feet onto each side, the length of the rectangle formed by the walkway and pool is 40 +4 +4 = 48 feet. Therefore, the area of the walkway and pool is (28)(48) = 1,344 ft^2. The area of the pool is (20)(40) = 800 ft^2. 1,344 ft^2 - 800 ft^2 = 544 ft^2. If you chose c, you extended the entire area's length and width by 4 feet instead of 8 feet."

If the height of the door is 6 ft 6 in, this is equivalent to 78 inches. Using the Pythagorean theorem, a = 78 and b = 36, we will solve for c. (78)^2 + (36)^2 = c^2. Simplify: 6,084 + 1,296 = c^2; 7,380 = c*2. Take the square root of both sides, c = 86. If you chose a, you added 78 + 36. If you chose c, you rounded incorrectly.

To determine the base and height we will use the equation x+4x=95. Simplifying, 5x = 95. Divide both sides by 5, x = 19. By substitution, the height is 19 and the base is 4(19) or 76. The area of the triangle is found by using the formula area = 1/2 base × height. Therefore, the area = 1/2(76)(19) or 722 cm^2. If you chose a, the area formula was incorrect.

        "answer": "A. 4,209 yd^2",
        "explanation": "There are two ways of solving this problem. The first method requires a linear equation with one variable. The second method requires a system of equations with two variables. Let the length of the rectangle equal x. Let the width of the rectangle equal x + 8. Together they measure 130 yards. Therefore, x+x+8= 130. Simplify, 2x + 8 = 130. Subtract 8 from both sides, 2x = 122. Divide both sides by 2; x = 61. The length of the rectangle is 61, and the width of the rectangle is 61 + 8 or 69; 61 x 69 = 4,209. The second method of choice is to develop a system of equations using x and y. Let x = the length of the rectangle and let y = the width of the rectangle. Since the sum of the length and width of the rectangle is 130, we have the equation x + y = 130. The difference is 8, so we have the equation x - y = 8. If we add the two equations vertically, we get 2x = 122. Divide both sides by 2: x = 61. The length of the rectangle is 61. Substitute 61 into either equation; 61 + y = 130. Subtract 61 from both sides, giving you y = 130-61 = 69. To find the area of the rectangle, we use the formula length x width or (61)(69) = 4,209. If you chose b, you added 61 to 69 rather than multiplied. If you chose c, the length is 61 but the width was decreased by 8 to 53."

Since the volume is 2887 cm^3 and we are asked to find the radius, we will set up the following equation: 4/3πr^3 = 288π. To solve for r, multiply both sides by 3; 4πr^3 = 864π. Divide both sides by π; 4r^3 = 864. Divide both sides by 4; r^3 = 216. Take the cube root of both sides; r = 6. If you chose a, the formula for volume of a sphere was incorrect; 1/3πr^3 was used instead of 4/3πr^3. If you chose c, near the end of calculations you mistakenly took the square root of 216 rather than the cube root."

The radius is 1/2BC or 1/2(10), which is 5. The area of the circle is π(5^2) or 25π. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length x width.

The formula for volume of a cone is V = 1/3(height)(Area of the base). The area of the base is found by using the formula Area = πr^2. The area of the base of the sand pile is π(16)^2 or 803.84 ft^2. The height of the pile is 20 feet. The volume of the pile in cubic feet is (803.84) (20) or 5,358.93 ft^3. To convert to cubic yards, divide 5,358.93 by 27 because 1 yard = 3 feet and 1 yd^3 means 1 yd × 1 yd × 1 yd which equals 3 ft x 3 ft x 3ft or 27 ft^3. The answer is 198.5 yd^3.

Since each triangle has a base of 4 and a height of 7, the area of each traingle can be found using the formula, area = 1/2base × height. To find the area of the octagon, we will find the area of a triangle and multiply it by 8. The area of one triangle is 1/2(4)(7) or 14. Multiply this value times 8; (14)(8) = 112. This is the area of the octagon. If you chose a, you used an incorrect formula for area of a triangle. Area = base × height was used rather than area = 1/2 base × height. If you chose d, you mistakenly divided the octagon into 6 triangles instead of 8 triangles. Another way to solve this problem is to use the formula for area of a regular polygon. That formula is area = 1/2Pa, where P is the perimeter of the polygon and a is the apothem. If we know that the octagon is regular and each side is 4, that means the perimeter is 8 x 4 = 32. The apothem is the segment drawn from the center of the regular polygon and perpendicular to a side of the polygon; in this case it is 7. We substitute in our given values and get 1/2(32)(7) = 112.",

To find the diagonal of the base, use 30 cm as a leg of a right triangle, 8 cm as the second leg, and solve for the hypotenuse.

To find the 1/2 area of the circle with diameter AC, we use the formula area = 1/2πr^2. Since the diameter is 6, the radius is 3; therefore, the area is 1/2π3^2 or 4.5π. To find 1/2 the area of the circle with diameter BC, we again use the formula area = 1/2πr^2. Since the diameter is 4, the radius is 2; therefore the area is 1/2π2^2 or 2π. To find 1/2 the area of the circle with diameter AB we use the formula area = 1/2πr^2. Since the diameter is 2, the radius is 1; therefore the area is 1/2π.

Finally, we will find the circumference using this new diameter. This will be the length of the fence. The formula for circumference of a circle is πd. This formula, along with the fact that the tower has a circumference of 40 meters, gives us the following formula: 40 = πd. To solve for d, the diameter, divide both sides by π. D = 40/π the diameter of the existing tower. Now increase the diameter by 16 meters; 40/π + 16 to get the diameter of the fenced in section. Finally, use this value for d in the equation πd or π(40/π+16) meters. Simplify by distributing π through the expression; (40 + 16π) meters. This is the length of the security fence.

        "question_urls": ["./images/geometry_question493.png"],
        "answer": "A. 360°",
        "explanation": "Using the illustration, ∠2 = ∠a. ∠2 and ∠a are vertical angles. ∠1 and ∠a are supplementary, since ∠c + ∠d + ∠1 + ∠a = 360° (the total number of degrees in a quadrilateral), 90 + 90 + ∠1 + ∠a = 360. Simplifying, 180 + ∠1 + ∠a = 360. Subtract 180 from both sides; ∠1+ ∠a = 180. Since ∠a = ∠2, using substitution, ∠1 + ∠2 = 180. Using similar logic, ∠4 = ∠b. ∠4 and ∠b are vertical angles. ∠3 and ∠b are supplementary. ∠e + ∠f+ ∠h + ∠3 = 360 or 90 + 90 + ∠b + ∠3 = 360. Simplifying, 180 + ∠b + ∠3 = 360. Subtract 180 from both sides, ∠b+ ∠3 = 180. Since b = ∠4, using substitution, ∠3 + ∠4 = 180. Finally, adding ∠1 + ∠2 = 180 to ∠3 + ∠4 = 180, we can conclude ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3 + ∠4 = 360.",

        "question_urls": ["./images/geometry_question494.png"],
        "answer": "A. 834π cm^3",
        "explanation": "To find the volume of the hollowed solid, we must find the volume of the original cone minus the volume of the smaller cone sliced from the original cone minus the volume of the cylindrical hole. The volume of the original cone is found by using the formula V = 1/3πr^2j. Using the values r = 9 and b = 40, substitute and simplify to find the volume = 1/3π(9)^2(40) or 1,080π cm^3. The volume of the smaller cone is found by using the formula V = 1/3πr^2h. Using the values r = 3 and h = 19, substitute and simplify to find the volume = 1/3π(3)^2(19) or 57 cm^3. The volume of the cylinder is found by using the formula V = πr^2h. Using the values r = 3 and h = 21, substitute and simplify to find the volume = π(3)^2(21) or 189π cm^3. Finally, calculate the volume of the hollow solid; 1,080π - 57π - 189π or 834π cm^3. If you chose b, you used an incorrect formula for the volume of a cone, V = πr^2h. If you chose c, you subtracted the volume of the large cone minus the volume of the cylinder. If you chose d, you added the volumes of all three sections."

        "explanation": "To find the volume of the object, we must find the volume of the water that is displaced after the object is inserted. Since the container is 5 cm wide and 15 cm long, and the water rises 2.3 cm after the object is inserted, the volume of the displaced water can be found by multiplying length by width by depth: (5)(15)(2.3)= 172.5 cm^3."

        "question_urls": ["./images/geometry_question496.png"],
        "answer": "A. 217.8 yd^3",
        "explanation": "To find how many cubic yards of concrete are needed to construct the wall, we must determine the volume of the wall. The volume of the wall is calculated by finding the surface area of the end and multiplying it by the length of the wall, 120 ft. The surface area of the wall is found by dividing it into three regions, calculating each region's area, and adding them together. The regions are labeled A, B, and C. To find the area of region A, multiply the length (3) times the height (10) for an area of 30 ft^2. To find the area of region B, multiply the length (5) times the height (3) for an area of 15 ft^2. To find the area of region C, multiply 1/2 times the base (2) times the height (4) for an area of 4 ft^2. The surface area of the end is 30 ft^2 + 15 ft^2 + 4 ft^2 or 49 ft^2. Multiply 49 ft^2 by the length of the wall 120 ft; 5,880 ft^3 is the volume of the wall. The question, however, asks for the answer in cubic yards. To convert cubic feet to cubic yards, divide 5,880 ft^3 by 27 ft^3, the number of cubic feet in one cubic yard, which equals 217.8 yd^3. If you chose b, you did not convert to yd^3. If you chose c, the conversion to cubic yards was incorrect. You divided 5,880 by 9 rather than 27. If you chose d, you found the area of the end of the wall and not the volume of the wall.",

        "question_urls": ["./images/geometry_question497.png"],
        "answer": "B. 104 ft^3",
        "explanation": "To find the volume of the sphere we must find the volume of the outer sphere minus the volume of the inner sphere. The formula for volume of a sphere is 4/3πr^3. The volume of the outer sphere is 4/3π(120)^3. Here the radius is 10 feet (half the diameter) multiplied by 12 (converted to inches), or 120 inches. The volume equals 7,234,560 in^3. The volume of the inner sphere is 4/3π(119)^3 or 7,055,199. (This is rounded to the nearest integer value.) The difference of the volumes is 7,234,560- 7,055,199 or 179,361 in^3. This answer is in cubic inches, and the question is asking for cubic feet. Since one cubic foot equals 1,728 cubic inches, we simply divide 179,361 by 1,728, which equals 104, rounded to the nearest integer value. As an alternative to changing units to inches only to have to change them back into feet again, keep units in feet. The radius of the outer sphere is 10 feet and the radius of the inner sphere is one inch less than 10 feet, which is 9 and feet, or 9.917 feet. Use the formula for volume of a sphere: (4πr^3)/3 and find the difference in the volumes. If you chose a, you used an incorrect formula for the volume of a sphere, V = πr^3. If you chose c, you also used an incorrect formula for the volume of a sphere, V = 1/3πr^3. If you chose d, you found the correct answer in cubic inches; however, your conversion to cubic feet was incorrect."

        "answer": "C. .062 in^3",
        "explanation": "To solve this problem, we must find the volume of the sharpened tip and add this to the volume of the remaining lead that has a cylindrical shape. To find the volume of the sharpened point, we will use the formula for finding the volume of a cone, 1/3πr^2h. Using the values r = .0625 (half the diameter) and b = .25, the volume = 1/3π(.0625)^2(.25) or .002 in^3. To find the volume of the remaining lead, we will use the formula for finding the volume of a cylinder, πr^2h. Using the values r = .0625 and b = 5, the volume = π(.0625)^2(5) or .0613. The sum is .001 +.0613 or .0623 in^3, the volume of the lead. If you chose a, this is the volume of the lead without the sharpened tip. If you chose b, you subtracted the volumes calculated."

The volume of the cube is found by multiplying length x width x height or (5)(5)(5) equals 125 in^3. The value of the cylinder is found by using the formula πr^2h. In this question, the radius of the cylinder is 2 and the height is 5. Therefore, the volume is π(2)^2(5) or 20π. The volume of the hollowed solid is 125 - 20π. If you chose a, you made an error in the formula of a cylinder, using πd^2h rather than πr^2h. If you chose c, this was choice a reversed.

The first arrow nicks one point on the edge of the bull's eye; the second strikes the center of the bull's eye. Kim knows the second arrow traveled 20 meters since she knows how far she is from the target. If the bull's eye is 4 meters wide, how far did the first arrow travel? You may assume that the arrows traveled in straight-line paths and that the bull's eye is circular. Round answer to the nearest tenth.",
        "options": ["A. 19.9 meters", "B. 24 meters", "C. 22 meters", "D. 20.1 meters"],
        "answer": "D. 20.1 meters",
        "explanation": "The shape formed by the paths of the two arrows and the radius of the bull's eye is a right triangle. The radius of the bull's eye is one leg and the distance the second arrow traveled is the second leg. The distance the first arrow traveled is the hypotenuse. To find the distance the first arrow traveled, use the Pythagorean theorem where 2 meters (half the diameter of the target) and 20 meters are the lengths of the legs and the length of the hypotenuse is missing. Therefore, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 and a = 2 and b = 20, so 2^2 + 20^2 = c^2. Simplify: 4 + 400 = c^2. Simplify: 404 = c^2. Find the square root of both sides: 20.1 = c. So the first arrow traveled about 20.1 meters. If you chose c, you added the two lengths together without squaring. If you chose b, you added Kim's distance from the target to the diameter of the target. If you chose a, you let 20 meters be the hypotenuse of the right triangle instead of a leg and you used the radius of the target."
